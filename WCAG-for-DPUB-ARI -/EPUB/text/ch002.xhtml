            <i>Movement</i> • People settle where they can most easily and comfortably meet their needs for clean water, food, work, communication, trade, and transportation. Before there were good roads, boats were the easiest way to travel or send and receive goods. As a result, people often settled near rivers, lakes, and oceans. They also often settled where the land was suitable for cultivation, and the climate was comfortable. You will not find many cities in the frozen wastelands of Siberia.</p>

          <p>Fifty nations signed a charter today to establish a new organization called the United Nations. The organization will go into effect October 24.</p>
          <p>The United Nations is a successor to the old League of Nations, founded after World War I to prevent another world war, which it failed to do. The purpose of the new organization is to maintain peace and develop friendly relations among nations.</p>
          <p>The member nations hope to cooperate to solve economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian problems and to promte respect for human rights and freedom.</p>

            <p>For centuries, people in different parts of the world have been trying to get along with one another, not always with success. Part of the problem is a lack of understanding of other peoples ways of life. Advances in communication and transportation, such as the Internet and high-speed planes, have brought people closer together. So have increased international trade and immigration. Knowledge of other societies is the key to understanding them.</p>

            <p>Social studies is a way to learn about the world. It draws on information from five fields of learning, geography, history, economics, government, and culture. Each field looks at the world from a different angle. Consider the approaches you might use if you were starting at a new school. Figuring out how to get around would be learning your school's geography. Asking other students where they come from is learning their history. Making choices about which school supplies you can afford to buy is economics. Learning the school rules is learning about its government. Clubs, teams, styles of clothing, holidays, and even ways of saying things are part of the school's culture.</p>

Artifacts include pots, tools, artworks, and even food remains. Using special techniques and tools, archaeologists carefully remove artifacts from underground or underwater. Then they use their knowledge about the place and people they are studying to figure out how the artifact was used.</p>

            <p>Looking at the long list of flavors at the ice cream store, you have a decision to make. You have only enough money for one cone. Will it be mint chip or bubble gum flavor? You will have to choose. Economics is the study of how people manage their resources by producing, exchanging, and using goods and services. Economics is about choice.</p>
            <p>Some economists claim that people's desires are unlimited. Resources to satisfy these desires, however, are limited. These economists refer to the conflict between people's unlimited desires and limited resources as scarcity.</p>

              <p>Amartya Sen (ah MART yah sen) was born in India. As a professor at Trinity College in Cambridge, England, he taught and studied economics. An important part of his research was to look at catastrophes, such as famine, that happen to the world's poorest people. By showing governments that food shortages are often caused by social and economic conditions, he hoped to prevent famines in the future. In 1998, Sen won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his research in welfare economics.</p>

            <h4>Interdisciplinary Challenge: Investigate Your World</h4>
            <p>Suppose that someone has given you a globe as a gift. What a great present! Unlike a flat map, your globe gives you a more accurate view of the world. Best of all, this new globe is programmable. You can input new information about different features and places on Earth. In fact, the manufacturer has set up a contest, the Global Game, giving prizes for the best and most creative approaches to programming the globe. Good luck!</p>
            <p>COOPERATIVE LEARNING</p>
            <p>On these pages are challenges you will meet in trying to win the Global Game. Working with a small group, choose which one you want to solve. Divide the work among group members. Look for helpful information in the Data File. Keep in mind that you will present your solution to the class.</p>

          <p>Meerut, India, May 10, 1857--</p>
          <p>Indian troops serving in the army of the British East India Company rebelled today. Reasons given for the revolt include anger at the way the company has been taking over Indian lands and a lack of respect for Indian customs. The immediate cause was the new Enfield rifles issued to the troops. To load them, soldiers have to bite off the ends of the cartridges. Word quickly spread that the cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat. This was an insult to both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. Hindus hold cows sacred and never kill them. Muslims believe the meat of pigs is unclean.</p>

            <h4>Different Places, Different Cultures</h4>
            <p>Indian soldiers and British officials belonged to cultures with different beliefs. The British came from a region of the world where most people ate the meat of pigs and cows. The Indians lived in a region where most people did not. A culture region is an area of the world in which many people share similar beliefs, history, and languages. The people in a culture region may have religion, technology, and ways of earning a living in common as well. They may grow and eat similar foods, wear similar kinds of clothes, and build houses in similar styles.</p>

              <h5>The World's Culture Regions</h5>
              <p>The map above shows the major culture regions of the world. Latin America is one culture region. The Spanish and Portuguese languages help to tie its people together. So does its common history. Southwest Asia and North Africa is another culture region. Most countries in this region share a common desert climate and landscape. People have adapted to the desert in similar ways, thus creating a common culture. Islam, which is the major religion in this region, also helps shape a common culture.</p>
              <p>Usually, not every person in a region belongs to the dominant, or mainstream, culture. Some regions are multicultural. For example, the United States and Canada contain other cultures besides the dominant one. Although most people in this region speak English, many people in eastern Canada speak French. Many people in the United States speak Spanish, especially in the Southwest. In both countries, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and members of other religions all flourish.</p>

When oil-producing nations in the Middle East raise the price of oil, for example, the price of gasoline at the neighborhood gas station is likely to rise. If there is an especially abundant banana crop in parts of Latin America, the price of bananas may drop at the local grocery store. More and more, people of different countries are becoming part of one world.</p>

            <h4>Defining the Skill</h4>
            <p>A time zone map shows the 24 time zones of the world. The prime meridian runs through Greenwich (GREHN•ich), England. Each zone east of Greenwich is one hour later than the zone before. Each zone west of Greenwich is one hour earlier. The International Date Line runs through the Pacific Ocean. It is the location where each day begins. If it is Saturday to the east of the International Date Line, then it is Sunday to the west of it.</p>

            <p>Use the strategies listed below to help you find times and time differences on a time zone map.</p>
            <p>How to Read a Time Zone Map</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strategy 1 Read the title. It tells you what the map is intended to show.</li>
              <li>Strategy 2 Read the labels at the top of the map. They show the hours across the world when it is noon in Greenwich. The labels at the bottom show the number of hours earlier or later than the time in Greenwich.</li>
              <li>Strategy 3 Locate a place whose time you know. Locate the place where you want to know the time. Count the number of time zones between them. Then add or subtract that number of hours. For example, if it is noon time on the west coast of Africa, you can see that it is 7:00 A.M. on the east coast of the United States. That is a difference of five hours.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>LITERATURE CONNECTIONS</h3>
          <p>The Giant Kuafu Chases the Sun</p>
          <p>FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES, people have created myths and legends to explain the natural world. Some stories explain why earthquakes occur or lightning strikes. Others tell how rivers, deserts, canyons, and other landforms came to be. This ancient Chinese myth, dating back at least 2,500 years, comes from the area of northern China where Chinese civilization first began. The myth explains how the province of Shaanxi got its mountains.</p>
          <p>Shaanxi, also known as Shensi, is in northern China.The southern part of the province contains the high and rugged Qinling Range, also called the Tsinling Mountains, where the average peak is 8,000 feet high and some are over 12,000 feet high.</p>
          <p>Long ago, soon after time began, giants roamed the flat and fertile Earth. One of the largest, bravest, and fastest of them all was named Kuafu-and his strength knew no bounds. Every day, Kuafu watched the sun rise in the east and set in the west.When night came, he became greatly saddened. He thought, "I do not like the darkness. All life falls into a silent slumber. If I could catch the sun, then I could keep night as bright as day. The plants could grow forever, and it would always be warm. I would never have to sleep again."</p>
          <p>
            <span
              id="WCAG-ch1-2.xhtml#p29"
              class="anchor"></span>
          </p>
          <p>The next day, Kuafu stretched his legs and started to race after the sun. He ran like the wind over several thousand miles without rest. Finally, he chased the sun to the Yu Valley where it came to rest every day but Kuafu was thirsty and very, very tired. His thirst grew, and soon it became overwhelming. He had never known a thirst like this, and his body seemed to be drying up like mud bricks in an oven.</p>
          <p>Kuafu found the nearest stream and drank it dry. It was not enough.With a giant's stride, he quickly reached the mighty Yellow River. He drank it dry, but again, it was not enough. He continued toward the Great Sea-surely it held water enough to quench his thirst.</p>
          <p>On his journey, he drank dry every well and every stream and every lake he came across. His thirst became overpowering, and Kuafu fell to the ground before he reached the Sea. In a fit of anger, with a branch of a peach tree, he made a final swing at the sun. But before the branch reached the sun, Kuafu died of thirst.</p>
          <p>
            <span
              epub:type="pagebreak"
              role="doc-pagebreak"
              id="page36"
              aria-label="Page 36. "></span>The sun set in the Yu Valley, and night came. When the sun rose again, Kuafu's body had been transformed into a mountain range. The peach tree branch extended from his side and formed a peach tree grove.To this day, the peaches in this grove are sweet and moist, always ready to relieve the thirst of those who would choose to chase the sun.</p>
          <p>Reading the Literature</p>
          <p>Before you read, examine the title. Why might the title character want to chase the sun? What abilities will he or she need to catch it?</p>
          <p>Thinking About the Literature</p>
          <p>Contests involving the sun, as well as efforts to reach the sun, are common in the myths and legends of many societies. Why do you think stories about the sun are told in so many cultures?</p>
          <p>Writing About the Literature</p>
          <p>Although Kuafu was not a real person, his myth has survived for thousands of years. Why? What does it teach about human behavior?</p>
          <p>Further Reading</p>
          <p>Legends of Landforms by <i>Carole G. Vogel</i> explores Native American legends about the origins of many places in the United States.</p>
          <p>Why Snails Have Shells by <i>Carolyn Han</i> retells the folk tales of the Han people and other Chinese ethnic groups.</p>
