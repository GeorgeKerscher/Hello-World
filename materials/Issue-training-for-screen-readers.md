One of the first uses of GitHub is to track issues. This is intended to help screen reader users get started with the web interface.

## Hello World repository for issue testing

Screen reader users can should read through the comments and leave one of your own. go to the comment edit field, go into edit mode (NVDA) xxx (Jaws) and when done go into browse mode (NVDA) and using first letter navigation hit "b" for button and leave the comment. Skip over the close comment buttons.

### Creating a new issue

Go to the Hello-World repo and under the issues page, you will find a link to a "new issue."  Click on the link, and in the title edit field, enter a name for your issue. Then go to the edit/comment/description edit fieldand leave a comment. You can type in plain text and if you want to format the comment using markdown, feel free to do so.

Go to the comment button to save your first issue.

People who have already commented will get an email that a new comment was made.

I created a Hello World repo as a playground for all kinds of things related to learning GitHub. The issue area is a good place for people to start.
