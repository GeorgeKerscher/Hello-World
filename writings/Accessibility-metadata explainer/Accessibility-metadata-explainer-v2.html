        <h2>What is Accessibility Metadata?</h2>
        <p>In the world of digital publications, "metadata" refers to data about data. For books and other educational resources, this includes basic information like title, author, and ISBN. <strong>Accessibility metadata</strong> is a crucial subset of this information, specifically describing a publication's accessibility features and limitations. It's essentially a set of labels that details how a digital resource can be used by individuals with disabilities and what assistive technologies it supports.</p>
        <p>The widespread adoption of accessibility metadata by publishers is growing, driven by evolving digital accessibility regulations and a commitment to inclusive education. This metadata helps ensure that digital content is "born accessible," meaning it's designed with accessibility in mind from the outset.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Publishers Provide and Distribute Accessibility Metadata</h2>
        <p>Publishers are increasingly embedding and providing accessibility information alongside their digital content. A common industry standard for communicating book metadata, including accessibility details, is ONIX (ONline Information EXchange).</p>
        <p>Distribution channels play a vital role in making this information available to users. Platforms like <strong>VitalSource</strong>, a leading educational content platform, actively incorporate and display accessibility metadata. When publishers submit their digital content, VitalSource searches for and presents this accessibility data on product pages within its store. This transparency allows purchasers to make informed decisions about the accessibility of the products they acquire.</p>
        <p>Many publishers are now using standardized workflows to submit comprehensive accessibility data, ensuring that features, potential hazards, and certifications are clearly communicated to distribution partners and, ultimately, to end-users.</p>

    <section>

                 <h2>Key Accessibility Metadata Items</h2>

                 <aside title="Publisher claims">
         <p>It is important to emphasize that accessibility metadata comes from the publisher and identifies the accessibility <strong>claims</strong> made by the publisher about their content. The overall accessible reading experience will depend on the reading system used to present the content, e.g., Both the content and the reading system must support selection of font size for the text to be displayed in a larger font.</p>
         </aside>


        <p>Key pieces of accessibility metadata provide critical insights into a publication's usability. Some important items include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Adjustments:</strong> Indicates whether the text and page layout can be modified by the user (e.g., changing font size, typeface, line height, word spacing, colors, and reflowing content). This is essential for readers with low vision, dyslexia,  or cognitive disabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for Nonvisual Reading:</strong> Specifies if all content essential for comprehension can be consumed in text form, making it available to screen readers, dynamic braille displays, or text-to-speech devices. This includes information about:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alt Text for Images:</strong> Descriptive text for images, crucial for users who cannot see the images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Captions/Subtitles:</strong> For audio and video content, benefiting deaf or hard-of-hearing readers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audio Descriptions:</strong> Narration of visual elements in multimedia for users with visual impairments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transcripts:</strong> Text alternatives for audio-only content.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Details the presence and usability of features like a fully accessible table of contents, in-book navigation, logical reading order, and print-equivalent page numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Alerts users to potential accessibility risks within the content, such as flashing lights (which could trigger seizures), motion simulations, or uncomfortable sounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Conformance and Certification:</strong> States whether the publication adheres to recognized accessibility standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 AA, or if it has received certifications like Global Certified Accessible (GCA).</li>
            <li><strong>Access Modes:</strong> Describes the primary ways information is encoded in the resource (e.g., auditory, textual, visual) and which combinations of these modes are sufficient to understand the content fully.</li>
            <li><strong>File Format :</strong> Information about the digital file format (e.g., EPUB 3, PDF.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Tagging:</strong> Helps screen readers pronounce text correctly by identifying the main language of the content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Empowering Persons with Disabilities to Identify Usable Titles</h2>
        <p>For individuals with disabilities, accessibility metadata is an invaluable tool for making informed choices about digital content. Before purchasing or accessing a title, they can review the metadata to determine if it aligns with their specific accessibility needs and the capabilities of their assistive technology. For instance, a user relying on a screen reader can check if a book has proper semantic markup, alternative text for images, and a logical reading order. Someone with a visual impairment can verify if the text can be reflowed and if color contrast adjustments are supported.</p>
        <p>This transparency enables users to avoid content that might pose barriers, saving them time and frustration, and ensuring they can engage effectively with their learning materials.</p>

<div><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to bring attention to the inclusion of MathML in publications. In the section "Rich content" there is the entry "Math as MathML." This means that true mathematics  is provided which Assistive Technology can effectively present in synthetic speech and refreshable braille to end users. In the past, images of math were provided and if alt text was included, it would be identified as "described math." It is by far more desirable to have MathML in Born Accessible publications than images of math.</p></div>

        <h2>Guidance for Educators and School Districts</h2>
        <h3>For Educators:</h3>
        <p>As an educator, selecting course materials involves more than just content relevance; it also means ensuring all students can access the material equitably. Before selecting titles for your courses, it is essential to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review Accessibility Metadata:</strong> Actively seek out and interpret the accessibility metadata provided by publishers and distributors. Understand the key features and limitations.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Student Needs:</strong> Consider the diverse needs of your students, including those with visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Informed Decisions:</strong> Use the metadata to determine if a publication will meet the needs of your students with disabilities without requiring extensive remediation or alternative formats. This proactive approach supports an inclusive learning environment from the outset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For School Districts:</h3>
        <p>School districts face increasing legal and ethical responsibilities to ensure their digital resources are accessible to all students. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title II updates, in particular, emphasize that public educational institutions must make their websites, mobile apps, and digital content "readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities," often aligning with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.</p>
        <p>Therefore, school districts should leverage accessibility metadata as a key factor in their material adoption processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Risk Mitigation:</strong> By prioritizing titles with robust accessibility metadata and certifications, districts can ensure compliance with regulations, reduce the risk of legal challenges, and protect federal funding.</li>
            <li><strong>Equitable Access:</strong> Selecting accessible titles ensures that every student has an equal opportunity to learn and succeed, fostering a more inclusive educational system.</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Partnerships:</strong> Districts should partner with content providers and platforms that are committed to accessibility and provide transparent, verifiable accessibility metadata. Some institutions even require independent third-party certification of content before purchasing.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Strategy:</strong> Incorporating accessibility considerations, guided by metadata, into content selection is a future-proof strategy that prevents costly retrofits and promotes a culture of inclusivity.</li>
        </ul>
